## Terminal (MacOs)

The Mac Terminal is a command line interface [(CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for the macOS operating system [(OS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). Mac Terminal is typically used by network administrators and advanced technical users who want to initiate an action that is not supported by the operating system's graphical user interface [(GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)
